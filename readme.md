# Advent of Code challenges
## 2020 - Rust
For 2020 I decided to challenge myself to complete all tasks in a new language for me - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started). So far it seems pretty awesome.

### 2020 Setup 
1. Set up [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started#platform-instructions-win) on your local machine.
2. ```cd aoc/2020/day-<numbet>```
3. ```cargo <build/test/run>```
