# Advent of Code challenges
## 2020 - Rust
For 2020 I decided on using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

Figuring out Rust was more than half of the process but funtional programming turned out to be quite fun.

### 2020 Setup 
1. Set up [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started#platform-instructions-win) on your local machine.
2. ```cd aoc/2020/day-<number>```
3. ```cargo <build/test/run>```

## 2021 - Elixir
This time I am trying another functional programming language - [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). 

Testing is much cleaner than in Rust, very helpful documentation and error messages.

### 2021 Setup 
1. [Install Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html#installation) on your local machine. I am using `v1.12.3`, but the code here should also work with newer versions. 
2. ```cd aoc/2021```
3. ```mix test``` to run all tests
4. ```iex -S mix``` to call functions from ```Aoc2021``` module and get some specific answers to tasks.
